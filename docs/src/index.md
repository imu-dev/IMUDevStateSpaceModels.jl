# IMUDevStateSpaceModels.jl

---

A minimalist implementation of some State Space Models crafted to be readily compatible with Neural Networks.

!!! tip
    Julia has already a host of excellent packages implementing State Space Models, as well as those that perform all sorts of inference, forecasting or simulation on them; see for instance [StateSpaceModels](https://github.com/LAMPSPUC/StateSpaceModels.jl), [DynamicalSystems](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl), [LowLevelParticleFilters](https://github.com/baggepinnen/LowLevelParticleFilters.jl), [Kalman](https://github.com/mschauer/Kalman.jl) or [DifferentialEquations](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/) for some examples that you should consider first, before trying to use this package.
